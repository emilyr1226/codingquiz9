Mini Max Sum: 
The time complexity of Mini Max Sum is O(n log n). This is because we first do constant intialization of two variables. Then, we have the Collections.sort function which takes O(n log n). Next, we have two for-loops, both with constant work. This means both these for-loops take linear time. Since O(n log n) is the largest, that is our time complexity. 
The space comlexity of MiniMaxSum is O(1).This because we are not using more space than our input list.

Weighted Uniform Strings:
The time complexity of Weighted Uniform Strings is O(n).This is because first we initialize a HashMap, which is constant. Next, we convert characters to an array, which is linear. Next, we have a for-loop with constant work, which is linear. Then, we have another for loop with constant work, which is linear. Lastly, we have a third for-loop with constant work, which is linear. Thus, the time complexity is linear. 
The space comlexity of Weighted Uniform String is O(n). This is because we use more space than our input list and string with our hashmaps.
